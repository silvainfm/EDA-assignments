# MOD 15

Welcome to our last homework assignment!

Just in case you haven't had enough practice dealing with messy data in your final projects, you get to now return to the data survey data our class collected!

Also, note, this week I wrote the homework in a plain markdown file. You'll have to use your own .rmd file or R script to answer the questions below. As usual, submit via the usual time and on github.

For this final homework, we are using the data file "EDA_2022_original_survey.csv". The original survey is here: https://forms.gle/ByG2xki7M2NUwVj56. Please let me know if this link doesn't work! It will be helpful for you to see the original survey questions.

1. Load the data, and be careful... you should want to change those column names.

2. Inspect the data. Then Write 3-4 COMPLETE sentences describing some challenges of this data for the data scientist. This can include things like missing data, features that are 'read in' incorrectly, poor or unclear measurement, odd characters to clean, etc.

3. Explore the data graphically and produce 2 substantively different presentation ready graphics.  Write 2-4 complete sentences interpreting your graphics.
